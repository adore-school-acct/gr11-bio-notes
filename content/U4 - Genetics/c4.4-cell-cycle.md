# C4.4 - Cell Cycle and Cellular Division

## Overview

- all cells come from pre-existing cells
	- conditions no longer favourable for abiogenesis
- two processes: *mitosis* and *meiosis*
- Reasons for Division
	- healing
	- tissue repair
	- growth
	- reproduction

## The Cell Cycle

![Cell Cycle|350](img/c4.4/c4.4-cell-cycle.png)

- life of cell divided into stages
- cell cycle divided into interphase and division
- **interphase:** phase involving cell growth, duplication of chromosomes, prep. for cell division

### Interphase

- 
- cell carries out metabolic processes and performs its reg. cellular activities
- cell prep. for division by
	- increasing protein supply
	- creating more cytoplasmic organelles
	- growing in size
- DNA of chromosomes duplicated

## Mitosis (M Phase)

![Mitosis stages visual|500](img/c4.4/c4.4-mitosis.png)

- Mother cell divides into two identical daughter cells
- Process found in unicellular and multicellular organisms
	- **somatic cells:** body cells
- involves division of nuclear material
- nuclear materials contains chromosomes
- **chromosomes:** condensed DNA
- chromosomes contain 2 identical sister chromatids held together w/ a centromere

### Prophase

![Prophase|300](img/c4.4/c4.4-prophase.png)

- chromosomes shorten and thicken, becoming visible
- sister chromatids still connected
- nuclear membrane dissolves
- centrioles migrate to opposite poles
	- only in animal cells
- spindle fibres (a.k.a. *microtubules*) start to form

### Metaphase

![Metaphase|300](img/c4.4/c4.4-metaphase.png)

- spindle fibers attach to centromeres
- chromosomes line up in middle of cell (equator)

### Anaphase

![Anaphase|300](img/c4.4/c4.4-anaphase.png)

- centromere splits and attached spindle fibers shorten
- pulls centromeres to opposite cell poles

### Telophase

![Telophase|300](img/c4.4/c4.4-telophase.png)

- chromatids reach opposite ends of cell
- nuclear membrane reforms
- **cytokinesis:** division of cytoplasm and organelles
- cytokinesis begins
- in plants, cell wall forms via cell plate between 2 daughter cells

### Errors in Mitosis

- mutations can disrupt normal process of mitosis
- mutations may arise through contact w/ carcinogens
- **carcinogen:** agents that cause cancer
	- may incl. toxic chemicals
	- radiation
	- viruses
- **oncogene:** gene w/ potential to cause cancer
- if certain oncogenes are altered, mitosis spirals out control resulting in tumour that can be...
	- **benign tumour:** non-cancerous tumour
	- **malignant tumor:** cancerous tumour
- oncogenes may also cause protein synthesis to increase unregulated

## Meiosis

- many multicellular organisms, including humans reproduce sexually resulting in a combination of traits
- sex cells divide differently so that when a male and a female sex cell fuse,
	- they have the correct number of chromosomes

### Sex Cells (Gametes)

- **gametes:** male and female sex cells (n or haploid, 23 in humans)
- **zygote:** fused cell (sperm + egg) (2n or diploid, 46 in humans)
- 2 cell divisions in meiosis
	- Meiosis I
	- Meiosis II

### Meiosis I (Reduction)

![Meiosis I|500](img/c4.4/c4.4-meiosis-i.png)

#### Interphase

Similar to mitosis

#### Prophase I

- most lengthy and complex phase
- homologous chromosomes or *homologs* line up
- result: tetrad
- **tetrad:** 4 chromatids
- homologs contain same genes but are not identical
- they may contain different alleles

#### Crossing Over

![Crossing over|300](img/c4.4/c4.4-crossing-over.png)

- crossing over occurs contributing to genetic variation
- **chiasmata:** visual manifestations of crossovers
	- greek: crosses

#### Metaphase I

- spindle fibers attach to centromere
- homologous pairs pulled to equator where they line up together side by side
	- **independent assortment** of originally maternal and paternal DNA

#### Anaphase I

- homologous chromosomes separate and moves to opposite poles
- centromere does not divide as in mitosis
- one chromosome from each pair now at each pole

#### Telophase I

- chromosomes uncoil
- spindle fibres disappear
- cytoplasm divides
- nuclear membrane reforms
- daughter cells diploid (2n)
- does not occur in all cells
	- if not, cell goes directly into meiosis II

### Meiosis II (Division)

![Meiosis II|500](img/c4.4/c4.4-meiosis-ii.png)

#### Interkinesis

- period of rest, some growth
- chromosomal duplication does not occur

#### Meiosis II

- identical to mitosis
- daughter cells divide again
- 4 haploid cells (n) results (gametes)

## Errors in Meiosis

- **nondisjunction:** failure of chromosomes to separate properly
	- result: chromosome may be added or deleted from a gamete
- **trisomy:** zygote has extra chromosome
	- i.e. trisomy 21 or Down Syndrome
- **polypoidy:** organisms contain >2 sets of chromosomes
	- rare in animals
	- i.e. seedless grapes and watermelon

### Changes in Chromosome Structure

- may spontaneously occur at any stage of development
- may or may not produce viable offspring depending on degree or severity

### Deletion of Deficiency

![Deletion|300](img/c4.4/c4.4-deletion.png)

- portion of chromosome deleted
- causes: viruses, radiations, mutagens
- i.e. *Cri du chat* disorder
	- seg. of chromosome 5 missing
	- cancer cells often show chromosomal deletions

### Duplication

- **duplication:** gene sequence repeats in one or several chromosomes
- i.e. Fragile X Syndrome
	- duplication of genes in X chromosome
	- results in mental impairment and autism-like symptoms
	- affects 1/4,000 males and 1/8,000 females
	- leading cause of inherited mental impairment

### Inversion

- 2 breaks occur in chromosome
- gene segment separates from chromosome and reinserts itself in reverse order
- generally viable and show no phenotypic abnormalities

### Translocation

- 2 nonhomologous chromosomes exchange parts
- most common are reciprocal translocations
- one segment is exchanged directly with another
- i.e. semisterility
	- half of gametes lethal to zygote
- i.e. Robertsonian translocation
	- 5% of all Down syndrome individuals
	- translocation of part of chromosome 14 and 21
