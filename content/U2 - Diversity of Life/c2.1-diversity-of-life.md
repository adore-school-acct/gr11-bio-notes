# C2.1 - The Diversity of Life

## Organizing Life: Criteria

- Morphology
- Habitat/niche
- Locomotion
- Colour
- Evolutionary history
- Food source

## Statistics

- 1.5 mil. species of animals named
- 1000s more animals being named each yr.
- All species named so far believed to be <20% of all living animals
  - <1% of animals, incl. those that lived in the past
- ~7.5 mil. animal species on Earth
- Best guess; do not include bacteria, protists, fungi and plants

## Examples of Species Richness

|Region|Area (sq. km)|Bird Species|Tree Species|
|-|-|-|-|
|Panama|15|443|1,320|
|Costa Rica|15|410|1,668|
|Ecuador|15|480||
|Peru|50|554|1,370|

- 1980s: Entolomologist Terry Erwin sampled 19 tropical trees
- Collected 955 species of beetle
- Extrapolated that there was ~30 mil. animal species in world
- **entolomologist:** person who studies insects
- **mammologist:** person who studies mammals

## Different Views of Environment and Ecosystems

- **instrumental value:** ecosystem's sources of economic wealth
  - i.e. food, timber, fuel, medicine
- Sources of inderect economic wealth
  - i.e. pollination, genetic info., recreation
- Cultural value for Aboriginal groups
- **intrinstic value:** value that cannot be measured in monetary terms
- Ecosystems and their components have a value that cannot be measured in dollars and cents
- Plants and animals have a value purely in themselves

> "A thing is right when it tends to protect the health and integrity of ecosystemsâ€¦. It is wrong when it tends otherwise." &mdash; *Aldo Leopold, 1949*

## Taxonomy

![Taxa](img/c2.1/c2.1-taxa.png)

- **taxonomy:** science of naming and classifying organisms
- ***Cf.* systematics:** science of determining evolutionary relationships among organisms
- Nested hierarchial system w/ defined levels of organization
- **taxon:** defined level in organization of life
  - pl. taxa
- 8 recognized taxa
  - In order from broadest to most specific:
  - Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species
- 3 Domains: *Bacteria*, *Archaea*, *Eukarya*
- 6 Kingdoms: *Eubacteria*, *Archaebacteria*, *Protista* (protists), *Plantae* (plants), *Fungi*, *Animalia* (animals)

## Classification Example

| |Leopard|Modern Humans|
|-|-|-|
|Domain|*Eukarya* (eukaryotes)|*Eukarya* (eukaryotes)|
|Kingdom|*Animalia* (animals)|*Animalia* (animals)|
|Phylum|*Chordata* (chordates)|*Chordata* (chordates)|
|Class|*Mammalia* (mammals)|*Mammalia* (mammals)|
|Order|*Carnivora* (carnivores)|*Primates* (primates)|
|Family|*Felidae* (felines)|*Hominidae* (hominids)|
|Genus|*Homo* (mankind)|*Panthera* (panthers)|
|Species|*H. sapiens* (wise)|*P. pardus* (leopard)|

## Binomial Nomenclature

- Developed by Carolus Linneaus in the 18th century
- Latin 2-part unique naming system
- Order of naming: *Genus species*
- Species: members of a populaton that can interbreed and produce viable offspring
- i.e. *Canis familiaris* (the family dog)

## Phylogeny

- **phylogeny:** evolutionary history of a species or group of organisms
- Organisms can be arranged by evolutionary relationship on a **phylogenetic tree** or a **cladogram**
- A clade on a cladogram represents one branch on a phylogenic tree
- **clade:** group of a common ancestor and all descendants
- All organisms in a clade must have homologous structures that do not occur outside the clade

### Cladogram

## Dichotomous Keys

- Used to identify organisms down to the species level
- Like a roadmap to a specific destination
- More accurate than a field guide
