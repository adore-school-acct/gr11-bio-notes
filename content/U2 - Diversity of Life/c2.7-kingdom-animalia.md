- Able to:
  - ingest food
  - circulate oxygen throughout body
  - dispose of undigested food and metabolic wastes
- Each species has...
	- **bauplan / body plan:** animal blueprint or master plan
	- incl. structural details and features like
		- type of symmetry
		- presence of body cavity
		- embryological devel.
		- segmentation
		- presence of head
		- \# of limbs
		- mobility
		- presence of backbone
- \>1 mil. animals in 35 phyla
- [[../U3 - Physiology/c3.1-internal-sys|Levels of Organization (4 Types of Tissues)]]

## What are Animals?

- Animals are eukaryotic
- Animal cells lack cell walls
- Animals are multicellular
- Animals are heterotrophs that ingest food
- Animals are motile at some point in their life cycle
- Animals form a blastula during embryological development
- **blastula:** hollow ball of cells

## Major Groups of Animals

- **invertebrates:** animals w/ no backbone (i.e. earthworm)
- **vertebrates:** animals that have notochord and backbone at some point in life cycle
- **notochord:** skeletal rod of connective tissue running beneath spinal nerve chord

## Body or Germ Layers

![Germ Layers](img/c2.7/c2.7-germ-layers.png)

- **body or germ layers:** cells in embryo that give rise to specific tissues in adult
- 3 Types &mdash; def. begins w/ *gives rise to*
  1. **ectoderm:** skin and nervous system
  2. **endoderm:** lining of gut
  3. **mesoderm:** organs, muscles
     - lacking in less developed animals

## Body Cavities

![Body cavity diagram](img/c2.7/c2.7-cavities.png)

- **coelom:** fluid-filled space between body wall and gut, derived from mesoderm
  - animals that have it: humans
- **pseudocoelom:** cavity that lacks true mesoderm lining of true coelom
  - animals that have it: Nematodes (roundworms)

## Embryological Development

- begin life as zygote when sperm fertilize egg
- blastula forms eventually
- infolding of cells occurs at particular spot in ball
- infolding eventually pushes all the way through hollow ball forming tube that connects both ends
- tube develops into *digestive tract*
- **blastopore:** first opening in digestive tract during devel.
	- **protostome:** animal whose blastopore develops into a mouth
		- protos = "first", stoma = "mouth"
	- **deuterostome:** animal whose blastopore develops into an anus

![Blastopore development](img/c2.7/c2.7-blastopore.png)

## Symmetry

![Symmetry of animals](img/c2.7/c2.7-symmetry.png)

- **asymmetrical:** no symmetry in organism
	- i.e. sponges
- **radial symmetry:** organism may be divided into multiple identical sections
  - i.e. jellyfish, starfish
- **bilateral symmetry:** organism has mirror-image right and left sides
	- organism has a true head region; concentration of nervous tissue in head
	- well-adapted for movement (streamlined to move quickly)
	- **cephalization:** development of distinct head w/ sense organs
	- i.e. fish, mammals, squirrels

### Segmentation and Limbs

- **segment:** repeating parts in animals
	- in many bilaterally symmetrical animals
	- **annelid:** segmented worms
		- i.e. earthworms
	- diff. sections like head, thorax, and abdomen of insects can also be specialized for specific functions
- **paired limbs:** external paired body part that extends from main body
	- in many animals w/ bilateral symmetry and cephalization
	- uses: movement, defence, sensory
	- examples
		- antennae
		- mouthparts
		- wings
		- gills
		- legs
		- fins
		- arms
		- certain parts of tail

## Invertebrate Bodily Processes

### Amoebocytes (Multi-purpose Cells)

* **Digestion**: These cells take in food, break it down, and move the nutrients around the sponge.
* **Circulation**: These multi-purpose cells handle the movement of substances.
* **Excretion**: These multi-purpose cells also deal with getting rid of waste.
* **Gas Exchange**: Gases move in and out at the cell level, mainly by spreading out (diffusion).

### Animals with a Simple Gut (Gastrovascular Cavity)

* **Digestion**: Food is processed in a simple pouch with one opening that acts as both mouth and anus. Nutrients spread to the cells lining this pouch.
* **Circulation**: In flatworms, this simple gut is branched, helping to spread nutrients.
* **Excretion**: Most waste moves from cells into the surrounding water. Cells with tiny hairs (cilia) push fluid containing waste out through branched tubes.
* **Gas Exchange**: There are no special breathing parts. Gases move across cell membranes, helped by the movement of fluids within the simple gut.

### Animals with a Body Cavity (General)

* **Circulation**: There's no dedicated system for moving blood. Nutrients are carried by the fluid within the body cavity.
* **Excretion**: A special gland or tube connected to an opening helps maintain water balance and remove some waste.
* **Gas Exchange**: Gases move across cell membranes.

### Animals with a Complete Gut (Tube with Mouth and Anus)

* **Digestion**: Food goes through a full tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other, having specialized parts like a stomach and intestine for processing.
* **Circulation**:
    * **Closed system**: Blood stays within vessels, pumped by a heart, and carries oxygen with hemoglobin.
    * **Open system (most species)**: A heart pumps fluid that flows freely within the body cavity.
* **Excretion**:
    * Special tubes (metanephridia) filter and remove waste from the blood.
    * Other specialized tubes (nephridia) also remove waste from the blood.
* **Gas Exchange**:
    * Moist skin acts as a breathing surface; oxygen from the skin is moved by the blood system.
    * In water, special structures called gills (in the mantle cavity) are used for breathing. This mantle cavity can also function as a lung on land.

### Insects and Spiders

* **Circulation**: A heart pumps fluid (not true blood) that flows freely within the body.
* **Excretion**: Special tubes (Malpighian tubules) remove waste from the body fluid.
* **Gas Exchange**: Aquatic forms have feathery gills. Land forms breathe through a network of tubes (tracheal tubes) throughout the body, while spiders have specialized structures called book lungs.

### Animals with a Simple Gut (Short Digestive Tract with Mouth and Anus)

* **Circulation**: Fluid in the body cavity moves nutrients around.
* **Excretion**: No special waste removal organs. Waste diffuses out from the body fluid and through a water-based internal system.
* **Gas Exchange**: A water-based internal system helps with gas exchange.

## Vertebrates

- **vertebrae:** series of skeletal segments in a backbone
	- sing. *vertebra*
- **amniotes:** animals that produce amniotic eggs or can reproduce on land
	- incl. reptiles, birds, and mammals
- **amniotic egg:** waterproof egg w/ shell, which allows vertebrates to reproduce on land

- **amniotic eggs:** eggs w/ a special membrane and a shell to prevent embryo dehydration
  - allows reptiles to lay eggs on land

### Evolutionary Origins

- Oldest known common ancestor to both reptiles and amphibians: *Casineria*
- reptiles said to derive from a common ancestor during the Middle Pennsylvanian Epoch (~312-307 mya)
- earliest undisputed reptile: *Hylonomous* and *Paleothyris*
- sister group to reptiles taxonomically: *Synapsida* (mammal-like reptiles)
- for mil. of yrs., reptiles and synapsids were similar
  - but over time, their lifestyles diverged and mammals arose from synapsids
- huge diversification of reptiles during the golden age of the dinosaurs, or the Mesozoic Era (biped dinosaurs were a thing)
- “Age of Reptiles,” the Mesozoic Era (251-65.5 mya)
- The earliest snakes evolved during the Middle Jurassic Epoch (174.1-163.5 mya)

*  transition from fins to limbs took over 80 million years, beginning in the Devonian Period  
* Tiktaalik: intermediate form between fishes having fins and terrestrial animals having legs  
* fossil evidence shows that amphibians arose from a lobe-fished lung ancestor \~365 mya  
* amphibians were dominant land vertebrates for over 100 my, known as the "Age of the Amphibians"  
* Frogs and salamander-like species appeared in the Triassic and Jurassic periods, with modern families emerging in the Cenozoic Era  
* arrived during evolution of animals from aquatic environs. toward terrestrial environs.
