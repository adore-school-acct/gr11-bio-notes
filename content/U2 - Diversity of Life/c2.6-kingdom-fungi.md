# C2.6 - Kingdom Fungi

## Overview

- Heterotrophic decomposers
- Consist of **hyphae**: tightly-packed filaments
- **mycelium:** *Hyphae* mass
- Surface to volume area of *hyphae* and substrate very high allowing maximum absorption
- Cell walls composed of **chitin**

## Division *Zygomycata*

- Common terrestrial moulds
- Live on decaying plant and animal matter
- Some are plant parasites
- Capable of sexual and asexual reprod.
- i.e. *Rhizopus stolinfer*, black bread mould

## Division *Ascomycota*

- Diverse group incl.
  - moulds
  - plant parasites like
    - powdery mildew
    - Dutch elm disease
  - ergot
  - yeasts
  - morels
  - truffles
- Terrestrial and aquatic
- Capable of sexual and asexual reprod.

![Truffle](img/c2.6/c2.6-truffles.jpg)

*Truffle mushrooms*

## Division *Basidiomycota*

- Mushrooms, toadstools, puffballs, rusts and smuts
- Grow spore-producing bodies called *basidia*
- Sexual reproduction only

### Examples

*Orange rust fungus*

![Corn smut](img/c2.6/c2.6-corn-smut.jpg)

*Corn smut*

## Mychorrizae

![Mychorrizae](img/c2.6/c2.6-mychorrizae.jpg)

- Form symbiotic relationships with plant roots
- Help plant to absorb nutrients like phosphorous and trace minerals
- Plant provides food to fungi
- Plant typically grows poorly in sterile environments

## Lichens

![Lichens](img/c2.6/c2.6-lichens.jpg)

- Mutualistic, symbiotic association between fungi and green algae
- Algae provide food for symbiont
- Fungi provide protection, structure and mineral nutrients
- Inhabit harsh environments but sensitive to pollution

### Examples

![Crustose](img/c2.6/c2.6-crustose.jpg)

*Crustose* (Encrusted) Lichens

![Foliose](img/c2.6/c2.6-foliose.jpg)

*Foliose* (Leafy) Lichens

![Fruticose](img/c2.6/c2.6-fruticose.jpg)

*Fruticose* (Shrubby) Lichens
