# C1.5 - History of Life and Modern Additions to Evolution

*PART I: History of Life*

## The Early Earth

![Illustration of early Earth](img/c1.5/c1.5-early-earth.jpg)

- Characterized by extreme heat, high UV, radio and electrical activity
- Primitive atmosphere contained nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ammonia, methane
- Asteroid impacts common
- Surface gradually cools, water vapour condenses forming oceans

## Miller-Urey Experiment

![Diagram of Miller-Urey experiment](img/c1.5/c1.5-miller-urey-exp.jpg)

- First life forms arose by **primary abiogenesis theory**
- **primary abiogenesis theory:** theory where life arose from no life
- Complex organic molecules form spontaneously
- Miller-Urey experiment recreated early atmosphere
- Sugars, amino acids, and nitrogenous bases created (building blocks of life)
- **Thermal proteinoids:** protein-like molecules formed abiotically from amino acids

## Protocells

![Protocell](img/c1.5/c1.5-protocell.jpg)

- All living things composed of cells
- Compartmentalization necessary
- ***liposomes:*** lipid membrane
- Lipid membranes form spontaneously
- Membranes may act as semi-permeable barriers

## Early Life

- RNA world? No DNA?
- Oldest fossils 3.5B yrs. old
- Cyanobacteria-like organisms (blue-green)
- Anaerobic and chemoautotrophs
- **anaerobic:** can break down glucose to energy w/o oxygen
- **chemoautotroph:** makes own energy through chemical reactions
- Eukaryotic cells (complex cells w/ nucleus) arise through *endosymbiosis*
- **endosymbiosis:** organism that lives within body/cells of another organism

## Endosymbiotic Theory

- **eukaryotes:** cells w/ membrane-bound organelles, nuclei, and complex organelles like mitochondria
- Infolding of membrane formed endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus
- **heterotroph:** organism that ingests organic carbon to produce energy
- Consumption of heterotrophic cell formed mitochondria
- Consumption of photosynthetic cell formed chloroplasts in plants

## The Cambrian Explosion

- Multicellular organisms arise 750 mya
- 565 mya: Animal kingdom undergoes dramatic increase in diversity
- All major animal groups arise in Cambrian explosion
- Early animals preserved in *Burgess Shale*

## Extinction Events

![Geological time map](img/c1.5/c1.5-geologic-time.png)

- Geological time divided into *5 **eras***, subdivided into ***periods*** and ***epochs***
- 5 major extinction events
- 65 mya: Cretaceous extinction ends the age of dinosaurs and gives rise to mammals
- **pseudoextinction:** the species never went extinct, they just evolved
- 6th great extinction?

## Human Disruption &mdash; Bison Skull Hunting and Processing

Bisons hunted w/ rifles which are accurate and have fairly fast reloads

## Rate of Evolution

![Rate of evolution morphology](img/c1.5/c1.5-roe-morphology.png)

- **gradualism:** evolution of species by gradual accumulation of small genetic changes over a long period of time
  - asserts slow, gradual change
  - small changes accumulate in species over time
  - first developed by Charles Darwin
  - *limitation:* in fossil record, species would arise abruptly, persist in rock for thousands/mil. of years, then disappear suddenly
- **punctuated equilibrium:** species often diverge in sudden bursts of rapid evolutionary change
  - developed in 1972 by paleontologists *Niles Eldridge* and *Stephen Jay Gould*
  - large changes occur rapidly followed by little change
  - term comes from idea that long periods of little evolutionary changes (equilibrium) are broken (punctuated) by shorter bursts of speciation

**FUN FACT:** Okapis and giraffes share the same evolutionary common ancestor

## Divergent and Convergent Evolution

- **divergent evolution:** evolution that creates species diverging in similarity
- **adaptive radiation:** when one species gives rise to many distinct species
  - caused by small founding group colonzing new environment and adapting to its environment over generations
  - the new group changes and loses compatibility with original group
- **convergent evolution:** distantly-related species develop similar adaptations, "analogous structures"

## Co-Evolution and Mimicry

- **co-evolution:** one species evolves in response to another species' evolutionary changes
- **mutualism:** when two species support each other in order to survive
  - i.e. flowers and insects have a mutual relationship w/ each other; insects get food and flowers get pollinated
- Plants evolved toxins to prevent insects from eating them, but insects also evolved to resist these toxins to eat them again
  - i.e. milkweed plants produce toxins, but monarch caterpillar can handle toxins and store them so that they aren't eaten
- **mimicry:** one species evolves to represent another species to gain a survival advantage
  - i.e. hoverfly looks like a wasp, and predators avoid both to avoid a poisonous sting
